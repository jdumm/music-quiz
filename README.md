# music-quiz

Play a quiz game that will play music for you and you'll have to guess the name of the song or
 artist.  
 
Current iteration: You have to guess the song that is currently playing.  Song choices are selected
 from that artists top songs.

## Purpose

How well do you know the music that you listen to?  Sure, Spotify is great for discovery of new
 music, but it can also be easy to lose track of all that great music.  Back in the old days, we
  used to have albums that we had to consciously decide to buy.  Naturally, we knew about all the
   artists we listen to and since we put in a certain album, we quickly learn and remember which
    songs belong to which artists.  
    
This game is set up to help you learn and remember more about the music you already love!

## Installation

More notes will come as this project evolves.  For now, you can install all the requirements
 locally using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt    
```

But the steps on creating an Spotify App are left out for now.
