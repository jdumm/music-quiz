# music-quiz

Play a music quiz game generated from your own Spotify playlists, Liked Songs, or Top Tracks.
  The faster you guess the correct track & artist, the more points you get!
 
Current iteration: Execute the python script `music_quiz.py` to play!


## Mission Statement

How well do you know the music that you listen to?  Sure, Spotify is great for discovery of new
 music, but it also makes it easy to lose track of all that great music.  Back in the old days
  , we used to have albums that we had to consciously decide to buy.  Naturally, we knew about all 
   the artists we listen to and since we put in a certain album, we quickly learn and remember which
    songs belong to which artists.  
    
This game is designed to help you learn and remember more about the music you already love!


## Installation

More notes will come as this project evolves.  For now, you can install all the requirements
 locally using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt    
```

But the steps on creating a Spotify App are left out for now.
