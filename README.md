## Production Note:

After discovering <a href='http://whisperify.net'>Whisperify</a>, I'm shutting down this project and
 looking to contribute to that open source project instead. I'll leave this repository open for
  any fans of using Spotify APIs through <a href='https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/'>Spotipy's</a> 
   Python interface.


## Mission Statement

How well do you know the music that you listen to?  Sure, Spotify is great for discovery of new
 music, but it also makes it easy to lose track of all that great music.  Back in the old days
  , we used to have albums that we had to consciously decide to buy.  Naturally, we knew about all 
   the artists we listen to and since we put in a certain album, we quickly learn and remember which
    songs belong to which artists.  
    
This game is designed to help you learn and remember more about the music you already love!
